# Accelerometer-Demo
This project is meant to display motion data provided by the ICM-20948 sensor on the BLUEIO-TAG-EVIM sensor board through BLE.

## App Features
Connecting to the sensor board through Bluetooth Low Energy using the GATT communication protocol after requesting Bluetooth Permissions.
The data displays motion data from the 9-axis ICM-20948 sensor's 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer on a motion/time chart.
Record data displayed on the chart on a local CSV file on the device, which can be downloaded after the session ends.
